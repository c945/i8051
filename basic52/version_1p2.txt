This file documents the changes made to Intel's MCS-51(tm) BASIC V1.1 or
better known as the BASIC in the 8052AH-BASIC chip. These changes were
made to allow the BASIC to run on an 8031/8051 uP system in external EPROM.

BASIC31 bug fixes: (see BASIC31.DOC below for BASIC31 features)
	- corrected bug to allow Baud Rate to be correctly loaded from
	  autoboot external EPROM at 8000H.

	- corrected bug which displayed garbage characters on console port
	  when printing with PRINT statements that were followed immediately
	  by PRINT# statements.

	- corrected Intel bug to allow autoboot EPROM at 8000H with program
	  with user command extensions to work. Also made BASIC31 compatible
	  with Intel work-around (see Intel TechBits - Ref. No. MIC-23, Oct.
	  10, 1986) for this bug (not needed).

	- corrected Intel bug to that discarded the 'F' in any variable
	  ending in F, FP, FPR, and FPRO and followed by a space.
	  (Note: this does not correct the problem of the character being
	         discarded from a variable that is the first character of
	         the last user added keyword extensions when it is followed
	         by a space.)

BASIC31 enhancements:
	- modified ISTACK check to allow for execution on 8052 or enhanced
	  8051 derivative to use 256 bytes of internal RAM if available.
	  (Uses Bit 51 {38.3/26.3H}: 0 = 128, 1 = 256 bytes internal RAM)

	- changed version number to V1.2a.

FILE: BASIC31.DOC	NOV. 1991

Summary:
	All 8052-specific functions/statements have been disabled.

	Due to the fact that the EPROM programming features do not work
	when executing BASIC-52 from external EPROM, all EPROM programming
	features have been disabled.

	Timer 1 defaults to the baud rate generation for the console port
	except during execution of any commands that send output to the
	list port and during the execution of the PWM statement.

	All other features/functions are intact.

Changes:
	Timer 2 Overflow Interrupt disabled.
	 - replaced with RETI instruction.

	TIMER2 special function operator disabled.
	 - generates ERROR: BAD SYNTAX message.

	T2CON special function operator disabled.
	 - generates ERROR: BAD SYNTAX message.

	RCAP2 special function operator disabled.
	 - generates ERROR: BAD SYNTAX message.

	PROG command disabled.
	 - generates ERROR: PROGRAMMING message.

	FPROG command disabled.
	 - generates ERROR: PROGRAMMING message.

	PROGx command disabled.
	 - generates ERROR: PROGRAMMING message.

	FPROGx command disabled.
	 - generates ERROR: PROGRAMMING message.

	PGM statement disabled.
	 - generates ERROR: PROGRAMMING message.

	Timer 1 used for serial console port. (19200 baud is maximum)

	EPROM baud rate value at 8000H converted to Timer 1 value when
	 used; i.e. - value stored in EPROM by BASIC-52 still works.

	Autobaud rate value converted to Timer 1 value.

	Reserved location 44H in internal memory used for Timer 1 baud
	 rate value.

	Timesharing of Timer 1 support added to PH0.#, PH1.#, PRINT#,
	 P.#, ?#, and LIST# statements so that when sending output to
	 the list device, Timer 1 is used for the list device baud rate.
	 Timer 1 is restored to the baud rate timer for the console port
	 when output to the list device is finished.

	Internal stack overflow checking modified to recognize that the
	 8031/8051 has only 128 bytes of internal RAM instead of 256 bytes.

	Timesharing of Timer 1 support added to the PWM statement so that
	 when generating output on the PWM pin, Timer 1 is used for that
	 timing. Timer 1 is restored to the baud rate timer for the console
	 port when the PWM output is finished.

	Sign-on version number changed to V1.2.

	"Modified by ..." text added to ^W^C message.

Enhancements:
	Backspace support added to line editing - in addition to the
	Delete character.

	The floating point subtraction routine modifications and the
	ASCII-TO-BINARY performance improvements from the OCTOBER 1991
	issue of Elektor Electronics USA have been added. (Note: The
	multiplication routine modifications from the NOVEMBER 1991 issue
	of Elektor Electronics USA were not included due to the fixes not
	performing as indicated in the article)

Anomalies:
	Due to the timesharing of Timer 1 during sending output to the
	list device (PRINT#, LIST#, etc.), a ^C (control C) will not stop
	the list output because Timer 1 is used for the output baud rate
	and the console serial port is deactivated.

	Due to the smaller internal RAM in the 8031/8051, the INTERNAL STACK
	is defaulted to 51 bytes instead of the 179 bytes in the 8052. This
	may cause some programs to generated an "ERROR: I-STACK". This is
	typically caused by too many nested levels of parenthesis "()", and
	can usually be made to work by breaking the expression into several
	less complex expressions.

Notes:
	These code changes have been tested, but is not guaranteed to
	be bug free (what software is?!).

	For those who haven't discovered this, BASIC-52 has a keystroke
	sequence ^W^C (control-W followed by a control C) that will
	display the developers' name, company, and date.
